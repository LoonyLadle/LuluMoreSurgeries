# Lulu's More Surgeries
Adds treatments for permanent injuries; scar removal, cosmetic and bone replacements.

## There are many scar removal mods; what makes this different?
Unlike many mods that add scar and other permanent injury removal, Lulu's More Surgeries programmatically determines whether an injury is a scar rather than having one recipe for every possible injury. This means body parts or injury types added by mods should function identically to vanilla. 

Additionally, scars can only be removed from skin-covered parts; scarred organs will still require replacement. Bone replacements can be installed on any solid part, with a special exception made for the spine. Cosmetic replacements can target any beauty-related part.

## Why did I make this mod?
I wished to heal scars but disliked that many scar-removal mods could remove permanent injuries from internal organs and used many different recipes to do so, cluttering the surgery select menu.

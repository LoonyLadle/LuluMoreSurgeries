# Lulu's More Surgeries
Adds cosmetic and bone replacements, hook hands, scar removal, stomach transplants, and various new bionics and implants.

## There are many scar removal mods; what makes this different?
Unlike many mods that add scar and other permanent injury removal, Lulu's More Surgeries programmatically determines whether an injury is a scar rather than having one recipe for every possible injury. This means body parts or injury types added by mods should function identically to vanilla. 

Additionally, scars can only be removed from skin-covered parts; scarred organs will still require replacement. Bone replacements can be installed on any solid part, with a special exception made for the spine. Cosmetic replacements can target any beauty-related part.

## What about the new bionics?
Bionic kidneys, livers, and lungs were added. Blood filtration is extremely important and even slight gains can be game-changers, so the relevant organs are slightly weaker than other bionic organs. Lungs provide a small reduction in toxic sensitivity, allowing colonists so enhanced to survive toxic fallout better. Like all bionics, these can be crafted.

The allnighter and subdermal armor implants were also added. The allnighter significantly reduces the speed at which the rest need falls, while the subdermal armor provides very strong additional protection for the whole body. They can only be acquired from traders or as special rewards.

## Why did I make this mod?
The surgeries in the base game are sufficient for most purposes, but lack a few high- or low-tech options in some areas. Additionally, I wished to heal scars but disliked many scar-removal mods could remove permanent injuries from internal organs.
